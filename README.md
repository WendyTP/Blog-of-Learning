# Blog of Learning

This is the project of creating my own blog site. It will host mainly my understandings of various computer concepts, but other topics may be presented here as well.

This is the front end part of the blog site, using Vue framework and Vue-Router. The mock-up blog post data is a json file, stored within the project directory.
